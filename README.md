# Mortgage Repayment Calculator

A responsive **mortgage repayment calculator** built with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.
This tool allows users to calculate monthly and total repayments based on loan details such as mortgage amount, term, interest rate, and repayment type (Repayment or Interest Only).

It also validates inputs, displaying error messages when fields are left empty or invalid values are entered. The project is fully responsive and optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

* **Mortgage Term**: Choose the loan duration in years.
* **Interest Rate**: Define the annual interest rate.
* **Repayment Type**:

  * *Repayment*: Calculates both interest and principal.

Error handling is included for missing or invalid inputs.
